# **Env Parser üõ†Ô∏è**

Parse your variables into objects easily, or use it to build something greater with them. Below is a simple explanation of how to use it. It runs smoothly on both the client and the server without conflicts.

When you provide `envPath` (the path to your .env file) as a prop, the function is called on the server side. Alternatively, if you provide `envContent` (a copy-paste of your env files), it runs on either the client or the backend, depending on your environment.

## **How To Env Parser**

### **Importing the Env Parser**

```ts
import EnvParser from '@bfzli/env-parser'

// or

import { EnvParser } from '@bfzli/env-parser'
```

### **Using The Import**

```ts
// If you want to run it on the server side, provide envPath. For client-side usage, provide envContent, as files cannot be read directly from the client.

const { success, error variables } = await EnvParser({
    envContent: '...',
    envPath: '.env'
})


if (success) {
    // Prints the parsed variables; may be empty if none are found.
    console.log({ variables })
}

else {
    // If an error occurs, it will provide details to help diagnose the issue.
    console.error({ error })
}

```
